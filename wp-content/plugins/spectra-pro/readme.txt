Spectra Pro works great with all the themes. But we do have a few suggestions for themes that could help make your WordPress website-building experience with Spectra Pro much smoother.

Compatibility with both the Astra theme and the Spectra One theme is exclusively tested and handled by us, ensuring that your website-building experience is a breeze.
