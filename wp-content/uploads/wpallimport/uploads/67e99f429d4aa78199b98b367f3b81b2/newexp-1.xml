		<title><![CDATA[10 Factors to Consider when Outsourcing IT Support Services]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>&zwj;<strong>Outsourced IT support</strong>could be a critical aspect of a company's infrastructure. Without efficient, reliable, and consistent IT performance, a large majority of organisations would not be able to function. In this article, we will discuss factors you should consider when outsourcing<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/it-support">IT support service</a>.</p><h2>What is outsourced IT support?</h2><p>For some companies having a permanent department to manage business needs is not always possible; therefore, most companies consider outsourcing to a team of IT support professionals. This option can save money, safeguard against cybercrime, and offer broadband and security solutions while offering specialist advice to promote economic growth.</p><h2>Ten things to remember while outsourcing IT support services</h2><p>Outsourcing IT support can be a great way to help your business stay up and running, but before making a decision, there are some important things to remember. Here are the top 10 things to keep in mind when considering outsourcing IT support services:</p><h3>Reduced costs</h3><p>The financial benefits of outsourcing to<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchitchannel/definition/managed-service-provider">managed service providers (MSP)</a>create substantial economic benefits for businesses in several areas.</p><p>The cost of an internal IT workforce and equipment and software upgrades could severely impact time and resources, preventing a team from tackling more urgent projects. Outsourcing IT support services will save considerable time and money on employing staff and purchasing equipment.</p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/63c6a3d5c99383e62bc6c2db_money-saving-piggybank.webp"></div></figure><h3>Account management</h3><p>Account Managers are committed to clients and are knowledgeable about their business operations and requirements. For larger companies, this is vital, as they have one point of contact with someone who knows their business well and with whom they have built a relationship.</p><p>An account manager offers a seamless service, often making it their priority to rectify issues immediately, maintaining professional, reliable assistance.</p><h3>Location</h3><p>While many IT support companies work remotely and numerous IT issues can be solved this way, it should not always be the only option. When it comes to upgrades and physical IT issues, a specialist visiting the office is a necessity.</p><p>It is also worth considering the&nbsp;advantages of employing a local IT support team, as new equipment, security camera upgrades, and broadband installation all call for on-site visits, which can incur unnecessary travel costs and additional charges.</p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/63c6a44794ee7333a0b0d9a9_man-office-helpdesk.webp"></div></figure><h3>Language</h3><p>Some companies outsource their IT across the globe, and although this may be financially tempting, there are risks involved.</p><p>Language barriers, cultural differences, international time zones, and a lack of understanding of local laws are just a few of the problems that could arise, along with data security and privacy issues depending upon the country&rsquo;s regulations.</p><p>Language barriers often lead to miscommunication and mistakes that can incur costs, so when considering an overseas firm, understand exactly how their service will be an asset to the company.&nbsp;</p><h3>Focused resources</h3><p>Technology develops at a tremendous pace, and it is imperative for IT support services to stay up to date. A company's internal IT department needs to invest significant time and money in technology to ensure all equipment and software are current. This, however, is carried out automatically by</p><p><a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/fully-managed-it-support">managed service providers</a>, who also give professional training to all staff members if required.</p><h3>Lower risk</h3><p>With 81% of company breaches attributed to weak passwords and a 30% surge in ransomware assaults, cybercrime is an issue that plagues the technology sector, and many businesses run a major risk of being victims. Therefore, any organisation must invest in reliable, secure software to avoid this.</p><p>IT companies are aware of these hazards and are skilled in managing and<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/blog/top-tips-for-improving-your-business-cyber-security">preventing cybercrime</a>, such as phishing. A business that wants to reduce risk and avoid being one of the 800,000 consumers hacked yearly should invest in a reputable IT support firm.</p><h3>Reliability</h3><p>Every company that outsources IT support services are entitled to an exceptional degree of dependability and service; even though it may be challenging at the beginning to build trust, reliability is a significant factor.</p><p>The use of information technology in the workplace is crucial. Therefore, many companies choose to have an internal IT department. Unfortunately, this has drawbacks unless they have adequate, reliable staff to support this department.</p><p>Outsourced specialists who are on standby to handle company concerns and urgent needs, reduce stress and reassure all departments that their technology is well cared for by a dependable provider.</p><h3>Expertise</h3><p>Research is a critical component in the process of hiring an agency. A business will come across hundreds of well-known, highly qualified IT suppliers eager to take on new clients.</p><p>Check out credentials and reviews when conducting research, and request samples of work, before arranging face-to-face meetings, where clients will establish whether they feel a good relationship can be forged.</p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/63c6a4c3665e39386906f5d6_woman-teaching-computer.webp"></div></figure><h3>Tailored packages</h3><p>Tailored services are designed to meet individual customer needs and preferences, making them more personalised than generic services, which are often &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; and less effective at meeting the specific needs of different customers.</p><p>Bespoke services operate more efficiently, as they are client-focused and therefore fit their needs perfectly, providing them with a convenient and efficient experience. This can help improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to increased business sales and revenue.</p><h3>It is a business decision</h3><p>The benefit of outsourcing is that many capable IT companies are willing to accept a contract and reach a cost-effective agreement; this allows both parties to concentrate on their core skills.</p><h2>Why do certain companies outsource IT services?</h2><p>There are several justifications for corporate when outsourcing IT support. Smaller businesses typically find it more cost effective than employing someone directly, especially as IT services are only occasionally needed. Hence, they receive far more value for money instead of paying a wage.</p><p>Larger businesses often have internal IT departments but also outsource work concurrently for several reasons. The IT department is frequently overworked or requires special services such as cybersecurity, reporting, broadband management, disaster recovery, or monitoring.</p><h2>How can outsourcing IT support help a business?</h2><p>As software is constantly changing and updating, it can be difficult for a company to remain at the forefront of technology. When outsourcing, this problem is removed.</p><p>Managed service providers are experts in their field. They offer invaluable 24/7 monitoring, training, and assistance on new software, enabling individuals to navigate any day-to-day issues easily.</p><p>Choosing the<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/">best IT outsourcing company</a>is crucial for every organisation, so choose carefully. Once recruited, the proper IT support offers limitless benefits.</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[10 Signs that it is Time to Change IT Services Providers]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Changing IT providers</strong>may appear to be more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth. Still, when considering lower costs, saved time, and improved service, an outsourced IT service is precisely what most successful businesses need.</p><p>Generally, companies continue to use the same<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/">IT provider</a>for prolonged periods due to convenience and dependability. However, it is essential to remember that every growing organisation deserves excellent IT management, and it is acceptable to seek out a different company that suits them.</p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/63c5702bc6651667653c1f8e_it-provider-stress.webp"></div></figure><h2>&zwj;<strong>What is an IT provider?</strong></h2><p>An IT provider is an independent company outsourced by businesses to ensure that their IT systems run smoothly, are updated regularly and remain secure while solving daily technical problems swiftly and efficiently. IT provider enables companies to focus on their core business operations without wasting time on frustrating IT issues.</p><p>Many offer fast broadband, giving smooth, seamless connections for multiple users, resolutions to cloud difficulties, strong cybersecurity, and disaster recovery. Another part of their service is report generation and training on new software while maintaining exceptional customer service and system performance.</p><h2><strong>Justifications for switching IT providers:</strong></h2><p>Switching your IT provider is an important decision that requires careful consideration of the changes' benefits and drawbacks. There are numerous reasons why switching IT providers may be a good idea, and weighing up all the pros and cons before making a final decision is essential.</p><p>Here are our top 10 reasons to justify making the switch, which should be taken into account when evaluating the available options:</p><h3>1. High costs and substandard results</h3><p>IT management is a crucial component in every organisation. Businesses today operate in a technology-driven environment; Therefore, delivering a reliable IT service is vital to smooth company operation. Just as competent<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/it-support">IT support</a>may increase capabilities, the same is true of ineffective assistance, which can seriously affect the company.</p><p>A recent survey found that 8% of small and medium UK businesses claim they have never received a contract from their MSP or admitted they have never read the terms and conditions. An agreement between a company and an outsourced IT provider will specify important information such as pricing ranges, technical specifications, and expected levels of customer service. Be warned, one example of a poor IT service is the absence of a contract.</p><h3><strong>2. Frequently receiving sluggish service</strong></h3><p>Reputable<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchitchannel/definition/managed-service-provider">managed service providers (MSP)</a>supply all clients with excellent transactional support, whether a large or small businesses. Additional extras such as impeccable customer service, transparent reports, and continued investment in their service should be included as standard and are the crucial differences between a low and high-quality provider.</p><p>An IT company is responsible for quickly and effectively resolving technology difficulties with committed customer care, often before the client realizes a problem. Sluggish service indicates an uncommitted company with poor standards and little desire to expand its customers' businesses.</p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/63c570bdf3c8d21a981f2471_office-it-support.webp"></div></figure><h3><strong>3. The IT provider is not equipped to handle emerging technology</strong></h3><p>Investing in new technology is vital to company success, and enthusiastic IT specialists understand that it can unlock business potential and give more freedom and security. They will urge companies to use these advancements as part of their regular contractual service. Although some organisations may be hesitant, new technology will not only significantly impact business growth but will also showcase the capability and confidence of the IT provider.</p><p>Those providers who do not embrace emerging technology and empower their clients with it are merely slowing them down and increasing the risk of cyber attacks from clever hackers.</p><h3>4. The unfamiliarity with other industries when Onboarding</h3><p>The onboarding process is vital to any contractual agreement when outsourcing to a new service provider. The IT business should have conducted in-depth research regarding their new client and created a robust understanding of their requirements and how they operate. This will enable the provision of specific or essential services, such as the need for 24/7 helpdesk support for hospitals.</p><h3><strong>5. Frequent below par IT system performance</strong></h3><p>Fast and efficient IT performance is an essential part of everyday life, therefore ensuring technology systems are running to optimum efficiency is a fundamental requirement of a service provider.</p><p>Frequent substandard performance can negatively impact an organisation and frustrate the end user. The outsourced IT company should ensure this never happens and endeavour to resolve any problems that arise quickly and efficiently, as system flaws lead to dissatisfied clients, a drop in business, and a stressful work environment.</p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/63c570c912b0af2f2f345899_it-system-support.webp"></div></figure><h3><strong>6. Irregular and weak communication with the IT provider</strong></h3><p>A company needs effective communication throughout the workplace to succeed, meet deadlines, and surpass goals. This should be no different when considering outsourced IT providers, as relationships are essential to expanding businesses.</p><p>Experiencing difficult communication is unacceptable and should signal that it may be time to re-evaluate the expectations and requirements of an existing IT team.</p><h3><strong>7. An Account Manager has not been provided</strong></h3><p>Account management aims to establish a comprehensive connection between larger companies and the IT support service, improving relationships and adding value to the service provided.</p><p>The effective utilisation of an Account Manager enables the development of a reliable, enduring connection and the delivery of a top-notch IT service, promoting customer satisfaction and, most importantly, loyalty.</p><p>Those support providers that do not offer an Account Manager risk a lack of cohesion between the client and an absence of understanding regarding the company's goals and aspirations, as there is no personal connection.</p><h3><strong>8. The IT provider fails to evolve with company demands</strong></h3><p>Expansion and growth are critical aspects of any business. As a company naturally expands, there will be frequent changes in the workplace, such as technological advances, growth in staffing, and larger profit margins.</p><p>An exceptional IT provider will anticipate these changes, take the opportunity to accommodate the expansion, make suggestions for further growth and ensure the company can update software, develop its support structure, and review its cyber security accordingly.</p><p>IT companies that do not keep up with the needs of clients can cause damage to reputation and repress growth.</p><h3><strong>9. The IT provider often generates reports late and incomplete</strong></h3><p>Monitoring reports that are comprehensive and issued when expected are a fundamental part of an MSP service that can critically impact the business by overseeing employee productivity, reducing infrastructure costs, and enhancing data flow.</p><p>Regular inspections are imperative to understand how every business performs from the inside, and providers will encourage clients to review, digest, and act on the information presented.</p><p>Experiencing late or incomplete reports could indicate that the IT provider is not monitoring the servers correctly or keeping track of business requirements, which can seriously affect productivity and operation.</p><h3>10. A business will frequently handle IT issues rather than contact its IT provider</h3><p>IT issues are usual in all businesses, as technology can't function correctly 100% of the time. An outsourced MSP will train employees in self-help methods to encourage them to fix simple problems themselves.</p><p>Unfortunately, some outsourced companies can have significant waiting times and unhelpful customer services that employees will quickly lose faith in. An IT firm is contractually obligated to help resolve any IT issues and should fix technical problems either before they arise or immediately after they have occurred.</p><p>If an IT supplier is not performing in a way that is expected or that was specified in a contract, a meeting with both parties should be held to address this issue. If the conclusion is not satisfactory, it is time to change provider.</p><p>Read more:<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/blog/10-factors-to-consider-when-outsourcing-it-support-services"><strong>10 Factors to Consider when Outsourcing IT Support Services</strong></a></p><h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>Working with a provider who fits your business model in every way is essential.

		<title><![CDATA[What is Cloud Computing, and Why Do You Need It?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>In today's fast-paced digital world, businesses and individuals constantly look for ways to manage and store data more efficiently. Enter cloud computing, a transformative technology that has revolutionised how we process and store information. But what exactly is cloud computing, and how can it benefit you or your business? In this blog, we will delve into the definition of cloud computing, explore its various types, and discuss its many uses.</p><h2>What is cloud computing?</h2><p>Cloud computing refers to delivering computing services over the Internet, often called "the cloud." These services include storage, processing power, databases, software, analytics, and artificial intelligence. By utilising cloud computing, businesses and individuals can access these services on demand, paying only for the resources they use. This eliminates costly infrastructure investments and allows for greater flexibility and scalability.</p><p>Read more:<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/blog/windows-365-in-the-cloud"><strong>Windows 365: In the Cloud</strong></a></p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/64197dda6231775813d913de_cloud-services-types.webp"></div></figure><h2>What are the three main types of cloud computing?</h2><p>Various types of cloud computing have emerged to cater to the unique needs of different users. There are three primary types of cloud computing: public, private, and hybrid. Keep reading to learn more about their features, advantages, and drawbacks, helping you decide on the right cloud solution for your needs.</p><h3>Public cloud</h3><p>The public cloud is a cloud computing service offered by third-party providers over the Internet. In this model, providers rent out computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and applications, to multiple users (also known as tenants) on a shared infrastructure.</p><h4>Advantages:</h4><ul><li><strong>Cost-effective:</strong>&nbsp;Public cloud users only pay for the resources they consume, which leads to reduced infrastructure and maintenance costs.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong>&nbsp;Users can quickly scale up or down their resources based on demand.</li><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong>&nbsp;Public cloud providers offer various services and tools, catering to different use cases.</li></ul><h4>Drawbacks:</h4><ul><li><strong>Security concerns:</strong>&nbsp;As users share resources in a multi-tenant environment, data security and privacy can be a concern for some businesses.</li><li><strong>Limited customisation:</strong>&nbsp;Public cloud services may not be flexible enough for organisations with unique or complex infrastructure requirements.</li></ul><h3>Private cloud</h3><p>A private cloud is a dedicated cloud computing environment that caters to the needs of a single organisation. The infrastructure, resources, and services can be managed by the organisation or a third-party provider. Private clouds can be deployed on-premises or hosted off-site.</p><h4>Advantages:</h4><ul><li><strong>Enhanced security:</strong>&nbsp;Private clouds provide a higher level of security compared to public clouds, as resources and infrastructure are not shared with other users.</li><li><strong>Customisation:</strong>&nbsp;Organisations have greater control over their environment, allowing for tailored solutions and configurations to meet specific needs.</li><li><strong>Compliance:</strong>&nbsp;Private clouds are ideal for organisations with strict regulatory requirements or sensitive data.</li></ul><h4>Drawbacks:</h4><ul><li><strong>Higher costs:</strong>&nbsp;Establishing and maintaining a private cloud requires significant upfront investment and ongoing expenses.</li><li><strong>Limited scalability:&nbsp;</strong>Scaling resources in a private cloud can be more challenging compared to public clouds due to dedicated infrastructures.</li></ul><h3>Hybrid cloud</h3><p>A hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private cloud environments. This model allows organisations to leverage the best of both worlds by deploying workloads and applications across both public and private clouds based on their specific requirements.</p><h4>Advantages:</h4><ul><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong>&nbsp;Hybrid cloud enables organisations to take advantage of the cost savings and scalability of public clouds while maintaining the security and customisation of private clouds.</li><li><strong>Improved resource optimisation:</strong>&nbsp;Organisations can allocate resources more effectively by deploying workloads where they are best suited.</li><li><strong>Enhanced business continuity</strong>: The hybrid approach allows organisations to distribute workloads across multiple environments, minimising the risk of downtime and data loss.</li></ul><h4>Drawbacks:</h4><ul><li><strong>Complexity:</strong>&nbsp;Managing and integrating multiple cloud environments can be challenging, often requiring advanced technical expertise and additional tools.</li><li><strong>Data transfer costs:</strong>&nbsp;Moving data between public and private clouds can result in additional costs, particularly when transferring large amounts of data.</li></ul><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/64197c1f82d66c7e37b2794c_cloud-computing-types.webp"></div></figure><h2>The main types of cloud services with example</h2><p>The cloud computing landscape has expanded rapidly in recent years, offering businesses and individuals a range of services to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve flexibility. Among the many types of cloud services available, three categories stand out: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). We will explore these three cloud service models, providing examples for each to help you better understand their benefits and applications.</p><h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3><p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-iaas#:~:text=Infrastructure%20as%20a%20service%20(IaaS,(PaaS)%2C%20and%20serverless.">IaaS</a>is the most fundamental cloud service model, providing virtualised computing resources over the Internet. It offers scalable and on-demand infrastructure, such as virtual machines (VMs), storage, and networking. With IaaS, users can quickly deploy and manage their virtual infrastructure without the need for costly physical hardware or data centre space.</p><h4>Examples of IaaS providers:</h4><ul><li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong>&nbsp;is a leading IaaS provider offering a wide range of cloud services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for virtual servers, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for scalable storage, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for networking.</li><li><strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>&nbsp;is another major IaaS provider, offering Virtual Machines, Blob Storage, and Virtual Networks. It also supports a variety of operating systems and programming languages, making it suitable for various business needs.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3><p>PaaS is a cloud service model that provides a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It includes tools and services for application development, such as runtime environments, databases, and middleware. PaaS simplifies the development process, allowing developers to focus on writing code and delivering features instead of managing infrastructure.</p><h4>Examples of PaaS providers:</h4><ul><li><strong>Google App Engine&nbsp;</strong>is a fully managed PaaS platform that supports various programming languages, including Python, Java, and Go. It automates the deployment and scaling of applications, allowing developers to focus on building high-quality applications without worrying about infrastructure management.</li><li><strong>Heroku</strong>&nbsp;is another popular PaaS platform that simplifies application deployment and scaling. It supports multiple programming languages, such as Ruby, Node.js, and PHP, and offers a range of add-on services, including databases, caching, and monitoring tools.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3><p>SaaS is a cloud service model that delivers software applications over the Internet on a subscription basis. SaaS providers host and manage the software, taking care of updates, maintenance, and security, allowing users to access the applications through a web browser without the need for installation or local storage.</p><h4>Examples of SaaS providers:</h4><ul><li><strong>Salesforce,</strong>&nbsp;a pioneer in the SaaS industry, offers customer relationship management (CRM) software that helps businesses manage sales, customer service, and marketing activities. Salesforce's cloud-based platform allows users to access their data from anywhere, making it an essential tool for modern businesses.</li><li><strong>Slack</strong>&nbsp;is a popular team collaboration and communication platform. It provides a centralised location for teams to share messages, files, and documents. With Slack's SaaS model, users can access their conversations from any device, streamlining communication and promoting productivity.</li><li><strong>Google Workspace</strong>, formerly known as G Suite, offers cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools, including Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides. Users can access these applications from any device, collaborate in real time, and store files securely in the cloud.</li></ul><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/64197c318d6355512e6c2953_cloud-computing-uses.webp"></div></figure><h2>Benefits of cloud computing</h2><p>Here are some key benefits of adopting cloud computing for both individuals and businesses:</p><ol><li><strong>Cost savings</strong>: Cloud computing reduces the need for expensive hardware, software licenses, and maintenance costs. Users can scale their usage up or down based on their needs, resulting in cost savings and improved efficiency.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong>&nbsp;Cloud computing allows users to easily scale resources up or down depending on their requirements. This flexibility means businesses can quickly adapt to changing demands without the need for significant investments in infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong>&nbsp;Cloud-based applications and data can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, enabling remote work and collaboration among team members in different locations.</li><li><strong>Reliability:</strong>&nbsp;Cloud computing providers typically offer robust backup and recovery options, ensuring that your data is protected and readily available in case of hardware failures or other issues.</li><li><strong>Security:</strong>&nbsp;Many cloud providers offer advanced security features, such as data encryption and multi-factor authentication, to protect sensitive information and ensure only authorised users have access.</li></ol><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/64197cb4b2e6420ee3d2f52c_cloud-computing-benefits.webp"></div></figure><h2>What is the future of cloud computing?</h2><p>The past decade has seen cloud computing transform from a novel concept to a ubiquitous part of our daily lives. With new developments on the horizon, it's essential to take a closer look at the future of cloud computing and the exciting possibilities it holds.</p><h3>Serverless computing</h3><p>One of the most notable trends shaping the future of cloud computing is the emergence of serverless computing. This concept allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. As serverless computing gains traction, it is expected to become a key enabler of new applications and services, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.</p><h3>Edge computing</h3><p>Edge computing, a distributed computing paradigm, aims to process data closer to its source. As the need for real-time data processing and low-latency applications grows, edge computing will play a crucial role in the future of cloud computing. By reducing the distance between data sources and processing points, edge computing can deliver faster response times and reduced bandwidth requirements.</p><h3>Multi-Cloud and hybrid cloud strategies</h3><p>Organisations are increasingly adopting multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies to leverage the unique strengths of different cloud providers. These strategies enable businesses to optimise their workloads, reduce costs, and minimise the risk of vendor lock-in. In the future, we can expect more organisations to adopt multi-cloud and hybrid cloud approaches, leading to increased competition and innovation in the market.</p><h3>AI and machine learning integration</h3><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming increasingly important in cloud computing. In the coming years, we can expect AI and ML to play a more significant role in optimising cloud services, improving security, and enabling new applications. This integration will lead to more intelligent cloud platforms that can adapt and learn from user behaviour and provide better, more personalised experiences.</p><h3>Enhanced security and privacy</h3><p>As cloud computing continues to evolve, security and privacy will remain top concerns for users and businesses. The future of cloud computing will see advancements in encryption technologies, improved identity and access management solutions, and the implementation of zero-trust security models. These measures will help safeguard user data and ensure the continued growth of cloud computing adoption.</p><h3>Sustainable cloud computing</h3><p>With environmental concerns becoming more urgent, the demand for sustainable cloud computing is growing. Data centres consume vast amounts of energy, and the future of cloud computing will need to address this issue. We can expect innovative approaches, such as energy-efficient data centres, carbon offset programs, and the use of renewable energy sources, to become more common in the cloud computing industry.</p>]]></content>

Remember that the business was asking for local charities and meritable causes to apply for their chance to get free used computers, all in working condition.</p><p>A total of 11 institutions and charities have now received almost four dozen second-hand laptop and desktop computers donated by the IT agency based in Grays. &ldquo;We received several requests, many more than we were initially expecting. Unfortunately, we couldn&rsquo;t help everyone, but we&rsquo;ve tried our best to fulfil the needs of as many institutions as possible&rdquo;, explains Hadi Marashy, TechVertu&rsquo;s Managing Director.</p><p>The institutions which received the donated IT equipment were spread across Grays, Basildon, Tilbury, Chelmsford, Clacton-on-Sea and Saffron Walden. TechVertu&rsquo;s team tried to visit as many institutions as possible to deliver the computers personally.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It was an enriching experience as we could see, first-hand, what type of difference our donations are going to make&rdquo;, Hadi Marashy says.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/">IT company</a>, part of the John F Hunt Group, expects to have more used equipment available soon and is planning to carry out other similar campaigns before summer.</p><p>&zwj;<strong>Meet the institutions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Thurrock&rsquo;s TNF team</strong>&ndash; Talking Newspaper Federation - sends out local news mp3 files on USB sticks to blind and partially sighted residents of Thurrock each week.</li></ul><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/6284b2e217f4a375f6cf808f_TNF-355x355.jpeg"></div></figure><ul><li><strong>Support 4 Sight</strong>assists people with sight loss, their carers and families.

		<title><![CDATA[How IT Support Can Save Your Team Time]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Many business leaders or owners ignore the IT aspect of their business until it&rsquo;s too late and mistakes are made. Especially smaller or start-up companies may think they&rsquo;re too small to need IT support. In reality, however, it is utterly false, and companies of all sizes can reap the benefits of outsourced IT support, regardless of their size. In this article we explore how investing in reliable IT support can help your organisation save valuable time.</p><h2><strong>Saves wasted time spent on training</strong></h2><p>In smaller businesses where employees must wear many hats, outsourcing your IT support can save your staff from spending too much time on training. Due to the constant emergence of new technology, the IT field requires a solid training-based focus to master and use these updated features effectively.</p><p>Read more:<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/blog/10-factors-to-consider-when-outsourcing-it-support-services">Factors to consider when outsourcing IT support services</a></p><p>Learning how to use the latest technology can also waste valuable business time and money if you&rsquo;re outsourcing this training. As a result, having IT support providers can help minimise this expenditure, as well as the time wasted implementing and learning it since most providers will already know standard systems and can integrate new features with your existing system.</p><p>At<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk">TechVertu</a>, we know how important it is for companies to save time on aspects such as training, which is why our customised IT services are ideal for freeing up more time so companies can put it back into other parts of their business.</p><h2><strong>Instant expert advice</strong></h2><p>For businesses that outsource IT support, one of the most significant time-saving advantages is the ability to contact their support provider at any time, anywhere for support in the event of a technical malfunction.</p><p>Having IT support will help you save time employing a professional to rectify the issue and reduce the time it takes to resolve the problems. You can rely on your outsourced provider to get the job done as soon as an issue is identified, ultimately saving your company time, and avoiding downtime.</p><h2><strong>IT support puts more time back into your business</strong></h2><p>Having to deal with technical issues can be a nightmare, especially when you have a business to run and other pressing matters to take care of. With outsourced IT support, all this stress and worry can be transferred to a qualified IT professional experienced in handling such problems, so you don&rsquo;t waste valuable business time trying to resolve the issue yourself.</p><p>Enlisting IT support services, like the ones we offer here at TechVertu, enables you to put then the time you could have wasted back into your business by allocating it to areas of the company that need it!</p><p><strong>Contact us today by calling 020 3821 1119 or emailing info@techvertu.co.uk to see how our</strong><a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/it-support"><strong>IT support company</strong></a><strong>could help save you and your workforce time.</strong></p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Identifying Spam Emails]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>One of the most common ways personal data gets leaked, or viruses get onto a computer, is through spam emails. In these emails, opening files sent as attachments or clicking on hyperlinks to unknown websites should be avoided at all costs, otherwise malware could do serious damage to not just your computer, but all your business&rsquo; network.</p><p>Another common type of deceptive email is called Spoofing. This means that someone can pose as one of your colleagues; you will see that the name on the email is the same, but if you look closer at the originating email address, you might find it is merely made to look very similar, with really minor changes. It is best to always question emails coming in requesting bank transfers to cover business costs, even if it comes from someone you believe to be legitimate.</p><p>Hacked email accounts can be very dangerous. If an outside source gains access to a colleague&rsquo;s account and sends something you deem to be suspicious, it is best you try to contact this person through some other means, as opposed to email. If the email has been infiltrated it could send links to even more people, compromising everyone.</p><p>If you believe you have received a spam email, the first thing to do is to check who is sending you the email; don&rsquo;t open anything you are suspicious of. If it is Spam and you are still unsure, contact your IT support team to let them know. They can block the sender or isolate any hacked accounts, as well as perform virus scans on your system to ensure it is clean of malware.</p><p>We have a team of IT experts always available to help you and your teams deal with annoying and time-consuming IT issues.

		<title><![CDATA[IT Support Vs Data Analyst: What's the Difference?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>The rapid rate of innovation has increased the pace of technological change, providing numerous opportunities for those with the required abilities.<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/it-support">IT support</a>and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis">data analysis</a>are two roles that typically involve using computing technology; however, their focus and job responsibilities differ. Keep reading to learn more about the IT support vs. data analyst job roles.</p><p>Both IT support and data analyst jobs are vital to improving the functions of organisations, but they have distinct descriptions. In this post, we compare and contrast IT support vs. data analyst, providing comprehensive information for those interested in pursuing a career as a data analyst or an IT support specialist.</p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/64008b662bd1b6489581dd38_data-analyst-woman.webp"></div></figure><h2>IT support vs. data analyst job responsibilities</h2><p>IT support is a catchall word that refers to a wide variety of endeavours that must be carried out effectively to ensure the optimal operation of an information technology system. This involves installing hardware and software, diagnosing and fixing problems, configuring networks, and assisting and directing users with technical questions and concerns.</p><p>On the other hand, gathering, evaluating, and comprehending information for the benefit of companies and organisations fall within the purview of data analysts. This involves building, testing, and deploying data models, developing algorithms to analyse data, providing reports and visualisations, and constructing a data pipeline.</p><p>The two positions often collaborate on finding solutions when dealing with complex business issues. IT support specialists offer the technical knowledge and assistance required to deploy data analysis solutions. In contrast, data analysts use their capabilities to analyse data and design strategies that assist companies and organisations in making educated choices.</p><h2>IT support vs. data analyst job qualifications</h2><p>While applicants with a bachelor's degree are preferred by specific organisations, IT support technicians are typically required to have at least an associate degree in computer science or a discipline closely linked to it. In most cases, a bachelor's degree is required of data analysts as well; however, the specifics of their study area might differ.&nbsp;</p><p>Many data analysts have academic backgrounds in mathematics, statistics, or computer science. Nonetheless, some data analysts may hold degrees in other fields, mainly if most of their educational background consisted of courses focused on data, such as those in economics or psychology.</p><h2>IT support vs. data analyst working conditions</h2><p>Professionals assisting with information technology and analysing data often work in offices. Yet, the atmosphere in which people operate is determined by the requirements of their employers.</p><p>For instance, a vast corporation's information technology department might work together to find innovative solutions for any issues and challenges. On the other hand, a small firm could have one or two IT team members responsible for handling difficulties for the whole organisation.</p><p><strong>IT support specialists</strong>often work during standard business hours; however, certain businesses demand them to be accessible around the clock, seven days a week.</p><p>This is because many IT-related problems arise outside of standard business hours. Data analysts work throughout regular business hours most of the time; nevertheless, some companies anticipate them to put in extra hours if it is required to do so.</p><p>These positions demand a high level of education and relevant professional experience. Moreover, candidates for both positions should have a solid grasp of computer systems and networks and the ability to adapt to emerging technology swiftly.</p><p>Read more:<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/blog/types-of-it-support-services"><strong>Five Types of IT Support Services for Every Business</strong></a></p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/64008b781247f205db08bf63_it-support-man.webp"></div></figure><h2>IT support vs. data analyst capabilities</h2><p>Support for Information Technology (IT) and Data Analysis are two of the most crucial and in-demand professions in today's work environment. Each role needs different skills, but they also have specific characteristics in common.</p><p>Knowledge of computers and other forms of technology is necessary if one aspires to work in information technology support. IT Support specialists need to be able to diagnose and fix problems with both hardware and software problems and network and security issues.</p><p>Moreover, they should be able to install and configure systems and have a solid grasp of the architecture of computer systems. Certifications and practical experience gained on the job will be used to develop one's technical talents even further.</p><p>In addition to having technical expertise, people who work in IT Support need to be able to interact effectively with clients and other team members and deliver clear and precise instructions. In addition, they should be capable of working individually and as part of a team and have good problem-solving and critical-thinking abilities.</p><p>Data analysts need a unique set of yet comparable talents. The ability to perform well in mathematics and an in-depth understanding of statistical concepts are essential qualifications for data analysts. Furthermore, they need to have a solid comprehension of data analysis and be competent in data mining and modification.</p><p>Last but not least, data analysts need to be able to effectively explain the obtained results to the other members of their team as well as to customers. They should also be capable of working individually and collaboratively and possess good problem-solving and analytical abilities. In addition, they should be able to work autonomously.</p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/64008b8bdcf3487a0d062930_computer-science-woman.webp"></div></figure><h2>IT support vs. data analyst income</h2><p>The annual income for an IT support specialist is, on average, &pound;32,500, whereas the yearly compensation for a data analyst is &pound;42,500 in the United Kingdom. Both incomes are subject to change based on the kind of business you work for, your experience, and the region in which you live.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This post attempted to explain everything regarding IT Support vs. Data Analyst subject. Despite similarities, the primary emphasis and tasks of the IT support specialist and the data analyst are distinct.</p><p>The primary responsibilities of IT support specialists include providing technical support to users and diagnosing and fixing problems with software, hardware, and network infrastructure. On the other hand, data analysts must gather, organise, and analyse data to derive insights and guide business choices.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>Want to develop a simple but efficient internal communications plan for your company? So make sure you follow these 3 easy steps.</p><h2>3 Key Elements for an Internal Communications Plan</h2><h3><strong>1. Objectives</strong></h3><p>Clearly state your business goals. An internal communications plan is ultimately a way to achieve an organizational outcome in a quicker and more effective way. But without your team&rsquo;s help, a business plan will never succeed. So, don&rsquo;t just state what the business goals are; make sure to explain to your employees what exactly is going to be achieved and, most importantly, what&rsquo;s going to change when those objectives have been accomplished. And don&rsquo;t forget &ndash; objectives don&rsquo;t always have to be &ldquo;end of the road&rdquo; type of results; they can and shall also include smaller but rewarding goals to be met along the way.</p><h3><strong>2. Plan of action</strong></h3><p>Now that you&rsquo;ve explained to your team what you want to achieve as a company, make sure you clearly state how you plan to achieve it. Never forget &ndash; without your team, your business will never accomplish anything so make sure you involve all employees on every step of the way. Explain what&rsquo;s expected from them and also what&rsquo;s in it for them.</p><h3><strong>3. Channels of communication</strong></h3><p>Create easy ways through which employees can give their contributions, share their opinions and help achieving the business goals. And make sure they understand when and how to use those channels. Facilitating the access to communications&rsquo; tools, which will help the organisation achieving its goals, is a key element to get higher levels of engagement from your employees.</p><p>If you still need help putting together a superstar internal communications plan, make sure you get in touch with our marketing &amp; communications team for a friendly chat.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/6284b2d520d99c8a7d5d0855_Voice-search-image.jpeg"></div></figure><p>Smart devices such as Amazon&rsquo;s Echo or Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana are becoming increasingly popular. So much that several studies and companies estimate that, by 2020, half of the overall searches will be conducted by voice.</p><p>With voice search, as the name suggests, users are able to make a query and do an online search by using only their voice. Who hasn&rsquo;t yet asked a question to Siri or Alexa, right? Those type of smart devices use speech recognition to understand your question and find the best answer(s) for it.</p><p>So, how do you (still) get your company&rsquo;s website to the first page of Google and make sure it&rsquo;s found by potential customers when everything we&rsquo;ve been learning about SEO and content optimisation seems to be changing so much? Well, you need to start optimising your content for voice search too. And the sooner you start, the better.</p><p>The growth and popularity of these smart devices and new voice-based technologies also means that the way people search for information is changing too. What someone types on Google for example, is different of what people ask Alexa. And websites need to be optimised for these new voice search techniques.</p><h2>What are the main differences between traditional search and voice search?</h2><p>1. People use longer sentences. Usually, when people do text-based searches, those are based in keywords or very short sentences. For example, when you&rsquo;re looking for an IT company in London you will probably type &ldquo;IT company London&rdquo;. However, if you make a verbal query, you will most probably use a full sentence. You will say, for instance, &ldquo;Do you know any IT company in London?&rdquo;. Therefore, your website content needs to be optimised for longer key phrases.</p><p>2. The intent is more specific.Companies need to be clever and start creating content that answers specific and appropriate queries. When someone types &ldquo;logo design&rdquo;, for instance, it&rsquo;s unclear if the person is just looking to find out more about logo design as a subject or if it&rsquo;s actually looking for a company or person who can provide that type of service. With voice search though, the intent is much clearer: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the best company to do logo design?&rdquo;, the person will possibly ask.Optimising your content to answer the queries which are more pertinent to your business&rsquo; purposes is extremely important.</p><p>3. Voice searches have a bigger local impact.Statistics show that voice searches are more likely to be used for local searches. Therefore, optimising all aspects related to your business location is also crucial for your SEO strategy.</p>]]></content>

		<content><![CDATA[<p>&zwj;<strong>With more than two billion active monthly users around the world, WhatsApp is by far the most popular messaging app. Unfortunately, since its creation 12 years ago, the app has been no stranger to convincing scams and SMS phishing attacks.</strong></p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/6284b34050fa0306d06107ae_Whatsapp-Hijack-scam-blog-image--1024x724.png"></div></figure><h2><strong>What is the WhatsApp hijack scam?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The scam itself is fairly simple and unfortunately has been around for years. When you first install WhatsApp on a new device, the platform will then ask for the phone number of the account. When you enter the phone number, you will then receive a text message giving you a one-time code. Once the correct code is entered, the phone will begin to receive WhatsApp messages. With this hack in particular, the attacker uses an already hijacked account to contact a victim&rsquo;s friend/family. In their message, the attacker commonly tells the victim&rsquo;s contact that they are having issues receiving a six-digit code, and as a result had it sent to them instead and to please send it back. That six-digit code is the WhatsApp verification code for the new victim, and by sending it to their friend/family they are actually sending it to the attacker. Once done, their own WhatsApp is hijacked!</p><p>&zwj;<strong>Read More:</strong><a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/blog/top-tips-for-improving-your-business-cyber-security"><strong>Top Tips For Improving Your Business Cyber Security</strong></a></p><h2><strong>What do the scammers do with stolen accounts?</strong></h2><p>The hijacker can message your friends/family and pretend to be you with your stolen account. A common trick is pretending that you are having a crisis and asking your contacts to send money. It also gives the hijacker your contacts' phone numbers, so they have the opportunity to continue to try the six-digit code trick with new victims. By hijacking your account, the scammer will also remain in any group chats that you are included in, where they could potentially see sensitive information.</p><h2><strong>How can you protect yourself?</strong></h2><p>According to WhatsApp, users must remain vigilant and not share the One Time Password (OTP) or SMS security code Users must remain vigilant and under no circumstances share the One Time Password or SMS security code with anybody, according to WhatsApp. For extra protection, users can also enable two-step verification to ensure complete safety. Finally, users must contact their friends or family members if they have received any suspicious messages on WhatsApp. WhatsApp has asked users to report any messages received from an unknown number in a guide you can view on their<a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/1313491802751163/?locale=en_GB"><strong>website</strong></a>.</p>]]></content>

We hope this demonstrates to our customers and potential clients that we are committed to the highest levels of performance, customer satisfaction and continuous improvement&rdquo;, says Hadi Marashy, TechVertu&rsquo;s Managing Director.</p><h3><strong>What do these standards mean?</strong></h3><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/6284b2fa80f7783924860597_UKAS-ISO-9001-1-988x1024.jpeg"></div></figure><p><strong>ISO 9001</strong>&ndash; was first introduced in 1987 and requires organisations to demonstrate that they do what they say they do, and that they have a Quality Management System in place to ensure consistency and improvement.

Thank you for being so understanding.</strong></p><p><strong>&zwj;</strong>TechVertu, an<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/">IT agency</a>based in Grays, has 35 desktop and laptop computers to donate to local schools, charities, and other commendable causes needing this type of equipment.</p><p>The company asks those interested in getting in touch by email or post stating how many computers they need and why. All applications must include the organisation&rsquo;s name, address and registered number if applicable; name and contact details for the person applying; and any additional information and documents to support the application (optional).</p><p>All the equipment is used, but it&rsquo;s in perfect working condition and will be donated to institutions located in Thurrock and the Essex area.</p><p>The applications can be sent by 15th January 2019 to vania.furet@techvertu.co.uk or by post to: TechVertu, London Road, Grays, Essex, RM20 4DB. TechVertu will then choose one or several institutions or causes to receive the IT equipment in the new year.</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to make just a random donation; we want to feel that we&rsquo;ve made a real difference. As a small, local new business, we want to help other people and other businesses to thrive. That&rsquo;s our motto&rdquo;, says the company&rsquo;s Managing Director, Hadi Marashy.</p><p>TechVertu has launched this donation campaign to celebrate its first anniversary, just in time for Christmas. The business was born in November 2017 when the John F Hunt Group invested in a small company, at the time named Ruuz. What started almost exclusively as a central in-house hub for the group&rsquo;s day-to-day IT and marketing requirements, with only two employees, has quickly grown to a full-service technological company. Currently, with 12 members of staff, TechVertu has all the resources, time and expertise to support or fully manage the IT systems for any other businesses, and it also offers comprehensive web development services to other companies.</p><p>&ldquo;We want to grow and have a positive impact in the local economy; we want to create more jobs, stimulate innovation, provide unique services to businesses in and around Essex and develop a strong corporate social responsibility&rdquo;, Hadi Marashy states.</p><p>In a year&rsquo;s time, the business hopes to have increased the team by at least 5 new members and opened a small office in Central London to work close to some of its clients based in the city. &ldquo;Our plans are bold and ambitious but we&rsquo;re confident we have everything we need to achieve them&rdquo;.</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Top Tips For Improving Your Business Cyber Security]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>The faster technology changes, the faster users and businesses need to update their<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/blog/what-is-cybersecurity">cyber security</a>. This key issue has been further affected by the Covid 19 pandemic, in which remote working has become a standard for employees in many organisations, with integration and flexibility among cyber security hot topics for home workers. <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/6284b344e42e5f0166a97ad6_Top-tips-for-improving-your-business-cyber-security-1024x576.png"></p><h2><strong>Remote working brings new threats</strong></h2><p>Cyber threats often appear in tandem with innovative working practices. People have always worked from home, but not in the numbers seen during the Coronavirus pandemic, and not using systems traditionally reserved for the workplace, such as call centres. Threats take many forms, including malware, toll fraud, and network targeting, as cyber criminals search for protection gaps. In addition to disruption and potential business losses, most organisations are also concerned about their legal compliance with GDPR legislation, other regulations, and government requirements.</p><h2><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication</strong></h2><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/what-is-multifactor-authentication-e5e39437-121c-be60-d123-eda06bddf661">MFA or multi-factor authentication</a>has always been considered an additional layer of security, but nowadays it is becoming much more of a norm. More often, this two-stage process is already commonplace for many people when they access their online banking or social media accounts. MFA is now a must for any business - using two or more simple verification steps to gain online access. This is typically a text with a code on a mobile phone after the username and password are entered. MFA is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect any business or organisation.</p><h2><strong>Managing security updates</strong></h2><p>Make no mistake, hackers and cybercriminals can easily keep pace with key decision-makers in new security software to ensure that applications are regularly updated, and patches are implemented when needed. The best way to do this is to thoroughly monitor and evaluate risks to protect data, thereby generating revenue and reputation. Old apps are risky and dangerous, and easy to overlook on outdated servers and workstations. The current trend for remote working means system audits depend on all devices and staff connected to the office network.</p><h2><strong>Dark web audits</strong></h2><p>Most people are becoming increasingly familiar with the dark web, which refers to the subterranean world of the Internet, full of illicit materials including usernames and passwords, credit card information, and medical data, all available to cybercriminals. A recent dark web survey revealed over 15 billion stolen logins from more than 100,000 security breaches. For a dark web audit, specialist knowledge and access are usually required. This can be a valuable process, as it allows companies and organisations to find out which key information is available for sale and where that data comes from. The emphasis on vulnerable information enables internal changes and increased security measures.</p><h2><strong>Anti-malware</strong></h2><p>The most effective and comprehensive option to protect against malware threats is to use a cloud-based solution that is centralised and protects all devices. When purchasing malware protection, it is important to focus on key features, including: anti-ransomware, global blacklisting, on-access scanning, endpoint software firewall control, endpoint drive encryption management, external device controls, auto-update of the device itself and pattern files.</p><h2><strong>Protocols and best practices</strong></h2><p>The best way to protect yourself from cybercrime is to write a policy that covers new and existing devices with regular maintenance, updates, reviews, and stress tests. Establishing a comprehensive system of protection does not have to be costly or difficult and gives businesses peace of mind. Use protocols and checklists for new devices and updates. Undergo evaluation reviews to test that the security is working and fit for purpose. Always use a key business change or major technological developments or upgrades as a trigger to review procedures.</p><h3><strong>About TechVertu</strong></h3><p>Whether you require<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/fully-managed-it-support">fully managed IT Support</a>or want to complement your internal IT Support team, our IT specialists will deliver expert, fast, and reliable IT Support services tailored to your requirements.

The reality is that companies rely on technology to succeed, and thus, the ability to manage IT processes is a must. This article will discuss the best types of IT support services and how your business can use them.</p><h2>Five popular types of IT support</h2><p>There are many<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/it-support">IT support services</a>available, from network support to security, and it can take time to figure out which services you need. Here are the most popular types of IT support that could benefit your company.</p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/63d7dbcb7cf33139123390c6_types-of-it-support.webp"></div></figure><h3>Managed IT support</h3><p>If you are looking for a way to take the hassle out of managing your company's IT infrastructure,<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/fully-managed-it-support">managed IT support</a>may be the right solution for you.</p><p>With this type of IT support service, you can entrust the end-to-end management and maintenance of your IT infrastructures to a third-party vendor; This includes installing IT equipment, network monitoring, data storage, and other technical activities.</p><p>You can choose which IT functions to outsource and the service level you wish to pay for. If you're ready to take the burden off your shoulders, consider managed IT services for your business.</p><h3>Microsoft Teams support</h3><p>Since its introduction in 2016,<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/microsoft-teams-tutorials">Microsoft Teams</a>has been a game-changer for businesses worldwide.</p><p>As the world has transitioned to remote work due to the COVID-19 epidemic, Teams has enabled companies worldwide to stay connected and collaborate with their employees from a distance.</p><p>Microsoft Teams has made communication more accessible than ever, from instant messaging and video conferencing to real-time collaboration and file sharing.</p><p>With this increased reliance on Teams, businesses must have the right IT support system to handle server changes, employee training, upgrades, issues, or other problems that may arise.</p><figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/63d27e05d42196387cd5dcbd_Microsoft-office-teams.webp"></div></figure><h3>IT network support</h3><p>Having a reliable network infrastructure is essential to keeping your business secure, making Network Support one of the most vital types of IT support for your business.</p><p>At the core of this infrastructure is the IT services provider, whose job is to protect your network from internal and external threats, achieved by installing and managing firewalls, monitoring for abnormal activity, and providing 24/7 monitoring for networks with specific needs.</p><p>Your IT support will also help to set up network policies that help to protect your company, such as blocking external logins, requiring<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/what-is-multifactor-authentication-e5e39437-121c-be60-d123-eda06bddf661">multi-factor authentication</a>, and more.</p><h3>Cloud services</h3><p>The 'cloud' is a term that refers to the use of the internet for storing, accessing, and sharing data and services rather than clogging up a local computer or server.

		<title><![CDATA[What Is a Phishing Attack in Cyber Security, and How Can You Prevent It?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Phishing attacks</strong>have become increasingly common in the digital age, posing a significant threat to individuals and businesses. Understanding these attacks and how they work is essential for safeguarding your personal and organisational data. This blog will delve into phishing attacks' definition, their types, and effective measures to prevent them.</p><h2>What is a phishing attack?</h2><p>Phishing is a cyber-attack in which attackers masquerade as trustworthy entities to deceive their victims into divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and other personal data. Typically, phishing attacks are carried out via email but can also be conducted through phone calls, text messages, and social media platforms. <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/642c2b671db7e540f7a156e1_phishing-cyber-security.webp"></p><h2>What are the types of phishing attacks</h2><p>Here we discuss the most common types of Phishing Attacks:</p><h3><strong>Email phishing attack</strong></h3><p>This is the most common form of phishing, where attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from a legitimate source. The emails often contain links or attachments designed to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware.<a href="https://terranovasecurity.com/top-examples-of-phishing-emails/">19 Examples of Common Phishing Emails</a></p><h3><strong>Spear phishing attack</strong></h3><p>This targeted phishing is directed at specific individuals or organisations. The attackers often gather personal information about the target to make the scam appear more convincing.</p><h3><strong>Whaling</strong></h3><p>A spear phishing that targets high-level executives or other high-profile individuals within an organisation. The goal is usually to access sensitive corporate data or financial information.</p><h3><strong>Clone phishing attack</strong></h3><p>Attackers create an almost identical replica of a legitimate email the victim has previously received, modifying the content to include malicious links or attachments.</p><h3><strong>Smishing and vishing</strong></h3><p>Smishing (SMS phishing) involves sending malicious text messages. In contrast, vishing (voice phishing) involves phone calls where the attacker pretends to be a legitimate representative of a known organisation, attempting to trick the victim into sharing sensitive information. <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/642c2b755946317a1e747904_mobile-phishing-attack.webp"></p><h2>How to prevent phishing attacks?</h2><p>There are several ways we can<strong>avoid phishing attacks</strong>:</p><h3>Educate and train:</h3><p>Provide ongoing education and training to help users recognize phishing attempts and understand the importance of not clicking on suspicious links or sharing personal information.</p><h3>Implement security software:</h3><p>Use antivirus and anti-phishing software to protect devices from malware and phishing attacks. Keep software and operating systems updated with the latest security patches.</p><h3>Use two-factor authentication (2FA):</h3><p><a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/blog/two-factor-authentication-guide">Enable 2FA</a>for all sensitive accounts, adding an extra layer of protection beyond just a password.</p><h3>Be wary of unsolicited emails:</h3><p>Approach any unsolicited email cautiously, mainly if it contains links or attachments. Verify the sender's email address, and contact the purported sender through a separate, trusted channel if necessary.</p><h3>Hover over links:</h3><p>Hover the mouse cursor over a link to reveal the destination URL without clicking. Do not click on the link if the URL looks suspicious or does not match the expected destination.</p><h3>Verify requests for sensitive information:</h3><p>If you receive a request for sensitive information, always verify the authenticity of the proposal through alternative means before sharing any details.</p><h3>Report phishing attempts:</h3><p>Notify your IT department or relevant security authority about any phishing attempts, so they can take appropriate action to protect others. <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/642c2b7f4f96d40b167973ce_cyber-security-attack.webp"></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Phishing attacks are a significant threat to<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/blog/what-is-cybersecurity">cyber security</a>. By understanding the different types of attacks and implementing the prevention measures discussed in this blog, you can better protect yourself and your organisation from falling victim to these scams.

		<content><![CDATA[<figure><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/6284b2d1344b38e25eb0962b_Adobe-flash.png"></div></figure><p>Adobe Flash is a multimedia platform which combines graphics, animation, video and sound. It is used for many websites to create rich dynamic content. However, hackers have always been known to exploit weaknesses in the security of Adobe Flash and use those to compromise systems. And now that Adobe Flash is embedded into Windows 10 and into browsers such as Chrome, it is more important than ever to protect against hackers using this to gain access to your data and infect your machine with malware.</p><p>One such weakness was revealed this week by cyber criminals and was first noticed by security researchers when a clinic, which provides medical and cosmetic services to high level employees of the Russian government, was targeted with a 0day exploit.</p><h2>&zwj;<strong>What is a 0-day exploit?</strong></h2><p><strong>&zwj;</strong>This is a security weakness in software which is not yet known or patched by the developers of the software. Bug bounty deals are often offered by developers of leading software to security researchers who find and report bugs. This usually allows those bugs to be fixed before hackers can use them. But exploits of this kind are also commonly sold on the black market, sometimes for very high sums. Having a tool like this, which has not yet had any patches developed, is powerful and can be used for targeted attacks like the one in the clinic.</p><p>Adobe have responded quickly to the news and have already released a patch in version 32.0.0.101 of Flash Player which protects against this exploit. It received the nickname &ldquo;Operation Poison Needles&rdquo; due to the location it was initially discovered. However, now that this has been disclosed publicly, many other reports of hackers using this same exploit to spread ransomware have come to light.</p><p>This malicious adobe flash code is often embedded into a regular word document. However, when you open it, it will prompt you to enable the malicious Adobe flash content. If you do so, your machine will be infected.</p><p>You can go to<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life-alternative.html">https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life-alternative.html</a>to download the latest updates to Adobe Flash.</p><p>You can always give our team a call and let us handle security updates like the above for you automatically. With our remote agent software we can ensure all of your systems are always kept up to date and protected against the latest generation of cyber threats.</p>]]></content>

		<title><![CDATA[Windows 11 vs Windows 365: What’s The Difference?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft announced the release of Windows 11 at the end of June. Only weeks later, they followed with a surprise introduction of Windows 365, a subscription service that takes the operating system to the cloud. It is designed for businesses, with IT managers and the new hybrid working era in mind. In this article, we will go through the features and benefits of both and explain the differences between the two.</p><h2><strong>What is Windows 11?</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-11">Windows 11</a>is the latest version of Windows operating system. After 6 years of the same user interface, the successor of Windows 10 has undergone a complete makeover, launching a fresher, more minimalist style than its precursors. Microsoft describes Windows 11 as a "calm and creative space" that "brings you closer to the people and things you love." Over the last 15 months, our devices have often been the only place where we can work, connect, play, be entertained and stay informed. Undoubtedly, this has influenced Microsoft's goal of making these areas intuitive and easy to switch between. <img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/610dfb67e987d82fadc6776c/6284b349344b38456cb0981d_MicrosoftTeams-image-1024x576.png"> Photo credit (Microsoft) - https://news.microsoft.com/june-24-2021/</p><h3><strong>New features for Windows 11</strong></h3><p>- The start menu has been refreshed and opens now from the centre of the taskbar. - Live tiles have gone, but are replaced by widgets for things like news, weather, and calendar events. - The addition of desktops helps you stay organised and focused by creating separate, customisable desktops for every part of your life. - Snap Layouts allows you to open multiple Windows simultaneously in your chosen layout, adapt to the size of your screen, while Snap Groups remembers collections of apps you have used and keeps them for you so you can return to them later. - Microsoft Teams is built into Windows 11 devices, so you can connect directly to your contacts from your desktop. - Vertical tabs make it easier to find what you are looking for, so you don't get lost in several tabs. - Updates are 40% smaller and occur in the background for fewer interruptions. No specific release date has been confirmed, but Microsoft said it will arrive during the 2021 holiday season. However, it is expected that this only refers to the date at which new laptops and PCs with Windows 11 pre-installed will be available to buy. Users who want to upgrade their existing Windows devices are likely to have to wait until 2022.</p><h2><strong>What is Windows 365?</strong></h2><p>Windows 365 is a cloud-based operating system. It&rsquo;s the latest service offering from Microsoft, which is referred to as a &lsquo;Cloud PC&rsquo;. It "combines the power and security of the cloud with the versatility of the PC" and allows employees to access their desktop virtually, rather than rely on a physical device. Influenced by the colossal change in our relationships with work and technology caused by the pandemic, Windows 365 has been created exclusively for companies to make hybrid work easier and more productive. The service reduces the security risks associated with working from home or using personal devices, as information is stored in the cloud, not on the device itself. Read More:<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/blog/windows-365-in-the-cloud">Windows 365 main features that help organisations</a></p><h3><strong>What is a Cloud PC: How Windows 365 works</strong></h3><p>Windows 365 is used and appears in the same way as the traditional Windows operating system, but is accessed and managed via your Internet browser or the Microsoft Remote Desktop app. Your entire desktop is stored in a secure data centre, not on your actual device. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the following in a recent statement: "Just as applications have been brought to the cloud with software-as-a-Service, we are now bringing the operating system to the cloud, giving organisations greater flexibility and a secure way to enable their workforce to be more productive and connected, regardless of location".</p><h2><strong>What is the difference between Windows 365 and Windows 11?</strong></h2><p>The main difference between the two is that Windows 11 is a traditional operating system that anyone can buy and install on their computer, while Windows 365 is a subscription service that allows companies to stream Windows 11 (or Windows 10) from the cloud to any device.</p><h3><strong>Key differences:</strong></h3><p>- A traditional operating system like Windows 11 is installed on your device and consumes RAM and storage space. Windows 365, on the other hand, does not take up any space on your device, as everything is stored in the cloud, but it means an Internet connection is required to run it. - Windows 10 and 11 are either pre-installed on devices or you buy a licence, and it's yours to keep forever. Windows 365, on the other hand, operates on a subscription model, so you rent your desktops essentially. This could prove useful if you hire freelancers or temporary workers, as you can quickly set up their new cloud PC and secure access to company data without the need to make long-term investments.</p>]]></content>

Microsoft is capitalising on the power of the cloud with Window 365, strongly aimed at business users who have transitioned to a hybrid workforce to elevate the workplace experience. Hybrid work has fundamentally changed the role of technology in organisations today, said Jared Spataro, corporate vice president,<a href="https://www.techvertu.co.uk/microsoft-office-365"><strong>Microsoft 365</strong></a>. With workforces more disparate than ever before, organisations need a new way to deliver a great productivity experience with increased versatility, simplicity and security. Cloud PC is an exciting new category of hybrid personal computing that turns any device into a personalised, productive, and secure digital workspace.
